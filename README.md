ðŸ”­ About me:

  Hello! My name is Alex Rossignol, and I'm 28 years old. I discovered the world of coding and programming in 2023, and since then, I have been self-teaching and diving deep into this vast universe. It's become a true passion and something I really enjoy.Previously, I worked for the Ministry of Justice. But in May 2024, I embarked on a career change journey and joined the Full-Stack Web Developer program at Wild Code School. I'm excited to learn more and dive deeper into the tech world! âš¡âš¡âš¡
